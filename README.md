# Github Control

Command Line Github Pull Requests control center

It is a simple-to-use, efficient for managing your currents open Pull Requests from Github.

## History of creation

I am still working on my terminal. As soon as I complete a pull request, I share it with my team and then start working on something else. I often forget the previous pull request,
and I find myself checking if the CI is passed, if my team reviewed my pull request.
It's quite time consuming on different projects, so I did this to be faster.

Feel free to give me feedback about it :-).

## Installation

Github-control is written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). You will need rustc version 1.45.2 or higher. The recommended way to install Rust is from the official download page.
Once you have it set up, a simple `cargo install --path .` will compile github-control and install it into `~/.cargo/bin/`.

### Cargo Install

If youâ€™re using a recent version of Cargo (0.5.0 or higher), you can use the `cargo install` command:

    cargo install github-control

Cargo will build the `github-control` binary and place it in `$HOME/.cargo` (this location can be overridden by setting the `--root` option).

### Homebrew

Coming Soon

If you're using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can use the `brew install` command:

    brew install github-control
